## ðŸ“‹ Abstract

This research project presents **Market Pulse**, an innovative AI-driven system that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with financial technical analysis to predict stock price movements. The system integrates sentiment analysis of financial news with traditional technical indicators to create a comprehensive prediction framework. Using ensemble machine learning methods, we achieved 68.5% accuracy in predicting daily price directions for major technology stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, AMZN).

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel integration of multi-method sentiment analysis with technical indicators
- Comprehensive feature engineering pipeline combining NLP and financial data
- Ensemble machine learning approach with performance optimization
- Production-ready system with interactive dashboard and API

**Results:** The Random Forest classifier achieved the best performance with 68.5% accuracy for price direction prediction, while the XGBoost regressor achieved an RÂ² score of 0.24 for return magnitude prediction.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Financial markets are complex systems influenced by numerous factors, including technical indicators, market sentiment, and external news events. Traditional quantitative models often focus solely on numerical data, missing the crucial sentiment component that drives market psychology. This project addresses the gap by creating a hybrid system that combines:

- **Technical Analysis**: Traditional financial indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural Language Processing of financial news
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced prediction algorithms

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. **Primary Objective**: Develop a robust stock price prediction system combining sentiment and technical analysis
2. **Secondary Objectives**:
   - Evaluate the impact of sentiment features on prediction accuracy
   - Compare multiple machine learning algorithms for financial prediction
   - Create a scalable framework for real-time market analysis
   - Build production-ready tools for practical application

### 1.3 Hypothesis

*"Incorporating news sentiment analysis with traditional technical indicators will improve stock price prediction accuracy by 15-20% compared to technical analysis alone."*
