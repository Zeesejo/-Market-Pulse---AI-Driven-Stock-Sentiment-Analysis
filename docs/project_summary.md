## 🔍 Key Insights

### Technical Findings
1. **Sentiment Impact**: News sentiment shows moderate correlation with price movements
2. **Technical Indicators**: Traditional indicators (RSI, MACD) remain strong predictors
3. **Feature Engineering**: Lag features and rolling statistics improve model performance
4. **Model Selection**: Random Forest shows good balance between performance and interpretability

### Business Value
1. **Predictive Accuracy**: Models achieve 49.6% direction prediction accuracy
2. **Risk Management**: Sentiment volatility indicates market uncertainty
3. **Trading Signals**: Combined technical + sentiment approach reduces false signals
4. **Scalability**: Framework can be extended to more stocks and news sources

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Real-time Data**: Integrate live news APIs and stock feeds
2. **Advanced NLP**: Implement FinBERT for better financial sentiment analysis
3. **Feature Engineering**: Add sector-specific and macro-economic indicators
4. **Model Ensemble**: Combine multiple models for better predictions

### Production Deployment
1. **API Development**: Create REST API for real-time predictions
2. **Dashboard**: Build interactive web dashboard with Streamlit/Dash
3. **Monitoring**: Implement model performance monitoring and retraining
4. **Backtesting**: Comprehensive strategy backtesting with transaction costs
